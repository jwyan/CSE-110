## About Me [section link](https://jwyan.github.io/CSE-110/#about-me)

*I am currently a 4th year Math-CS major studying at the Univerisity of California, San Diego.*

One of my favorite quotes is by **Eleanor Roosevelt**: 
> The future belongs to those who belive in the beauty of their dreams.


This quote has inspired me to dream bigger and greater. It has also influenced me to focus on the present and the future rather than reminiscing in the past. 

I also tend to forget my git commands so I will include them below as reference. 
``` 
git status 
git add 
git commit -m "message" 
git push
```
